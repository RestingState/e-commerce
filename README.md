# Configuration
## In order to start the server you should:
1. Install all the needed dependencies
2. Use a special command for running the server  

**Make sure you're in server folder! Otherwise, commands won't work.**
### 1. Install dependencies  
In order to install dependencies use command: **npm install**  
This should install all the required dependencies on your machine,
by creating a new folder called **node_modules**

### 2. Start server
You can start the server in two different modes: **development mode** and **start mode**

#### 1) Development mode
You can start the server in this mode using a command: **npm run dev**  
In this mode you can change the code and the server would refresh automatically.  

#### 2) Start mode
You can start the server in this mode using a command: **npm run start**  
This command just starts a server without any developments tools.
